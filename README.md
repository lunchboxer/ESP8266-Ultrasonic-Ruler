# ESP8266-Ultrasonic-Ruler
Ultrasonic ruler Arduino project for Wemos D1 mini

This project uses platformio and is set up for emacs, but should work in any editor.

## Purpose

Primary school students can apply the concept of measuring distances using a known fixed speed and measuring the time, with a ultrasonic ruler. Distance equals speed times time and the speed of sound is about 340 m/s depending on temperature and humidity.

## Components

The project uses:
- Wemos D1 Mini esp8266 microcontroller
- 0.91 inch four-pin OLED display
- HC SR04 ultrasonic ranging module.
